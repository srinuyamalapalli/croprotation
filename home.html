    <h1> CROP ROTATION </h1>
    <div class="para">
        Crop rotation refers to the cultivation of different crops on a piece of land over time. The succession of crops
        to be grown is carefully designed to ensure soil nutrients are sustained, pest populations are controlled, weeds
        are suppressed and soil health is built. A crop rotation will cycle through cash crops (such as vegetables),
        cover crops (grasses and cereals) and green manures (Often legumes). The exact sequence of crops will vary
        depending on local circumstances, with the critical design element being an understanding what each crop
        contributes and takes from the soil. For instance, nitrogen depleting crop should be preceded by a nitrogen
        fixing crop. The central idea is to have the crops themselves sustain soil health rather than planting the same
        crop year in year out, and then repairing soil health throughout fertilizers and herbicides.
